            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
            They said, <q class="vil">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> 
            The farmer said, <q class="farm"><em>Maybe</em>.</q> </p>
            <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="vil">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>
            The farmer again said, <q class="farm"><em>Maybe</em>.</q></p> 
            <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="vil">Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad emphasized-bad">bad</span></q>, and the farmer responded, <q class="farm"><em>Maybe</em></q>. The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="vil">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="farm"><em>Maybe</em>.</q></p>
            <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good emphasized-good">good</span> or <span class="bad emphasized-bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good emphasized-good">good</span> fortune.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p><span class="good emphasized-good">Good</span> and <span class="bad emphasized-bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good emphasized-good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good emphasized-good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
